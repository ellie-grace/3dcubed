                <h3>About The Company</h3>

                <p>3D Cubed Ltd was established in 2000 to provide engineering and design services to small companies.  In the first few years the focus was on producing check drawings for car, yacht and architectural scale models.  This rapidly changed to producing full solid models and production information for models for direct manufacture.  As the company matured it became involved in designs for medical ventilators, street lights, miniature jet engines and small wind turbines.</p>
				<br>
				<p>2005 saw the company diversify into producing planning layouts for local residents and a brief foray into the production of aluminium and plastic trims and flashings for a local flat roofing company.  From those contracts the company then began specialising in the production of layout drawings for a specialist tapered insulation supplier to the commercial roofing sector, which remains as the core business to date.  Many of the large contractors also require specialised 2D cross-section drawings for specific projects as well the production of photo-realistic instruction manual graphics.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The company still retains the ability to design small prototypes for industry and private individuals and has recently invested in a small 3D printer to produce models for proof of concept.</p>
