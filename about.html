                <h2>About The Company</h2>

                <p>3D Cubed Ltd was established in 2000 to provide engineering and design services to small companies.  In the first few years the focus was on producing check drawings for car, yacht and architectural scale models.  This rapidly changed to producing full solid models and production information for models for direct manufacture.  As the company matured I became involved in designs for medical ventilators, street lights, miniature jet engines and small wind turbines.
                </p>
                <p>2005 saw the company diversify into producing planning layouts for local residents and a brief foray into the production of aluminium and plastic trims and flashings for a local flat roofing company.  From those contracts the company then began specialising in the production of layout drawings for a specialist tapered insulation supplier which remains as the core business to date, as well as production of instruction manual graphics for the major commercial roofing contractors utilising this type of insulation.  The company still works in the design and production of custom switch gear for the mining industry.</p>
